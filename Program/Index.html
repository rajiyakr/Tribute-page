        <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as "Bapu," remains an enduring symbol of peace, justice, and nonviolent resistance. His life and legacy continue to inspire millions around the world.<br></p>
        <p>Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Gandhi embarked on a remarkable journey that would shape the course of history. His unwavering commitment to truth, nonviolence, and civil disobedience became the driving force behind India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule.<br>
            Gandhi's philosophy of "Satyagraha," the power of truth and love, transformed the landscape of social and political change. He led massive nonviolent movements such as the Salt March, the Quit India Movement, and countless hunger strikes, all aimed at achieving freedom and justice through peaceful means.
            Beyond India's borders, Gandhi's message of nonviolence resonated globally, influencing civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. His teachings transcended nations and cultures, advocating for harmony, equality, and the eradication of poverty.<br></p>
        <p>Today, we honour the Mahatma's enduring legacy by embracing his principles of tolerance, compassion, and social justice. As we remember Mahatma Gandhi, let us recommit ourselves to the pursuit of a more peaceful and just world, where love triumphs over hatred and nonviolence conquers oppression.<br></p>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi's life reminds us that even one person armed with truth and a steadfast commitment to justice can change the course of history. His example challenges us to be the change we wish to see in the world and to work tirelessly for a brighter, more equitable future.<br></p>
        <p class="last-p">On this day, and every day, we pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of Mahatma Gandhi, a beacon of hope and an enduring symbol of peace for generations to come.<br></p>
